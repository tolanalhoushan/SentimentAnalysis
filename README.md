## Overview
This project builds a IMBD Movies Reviews Sentiment Analysis using the IMDb 10k Movie Reviews Dataset that classifies the review as positive / negative based on the written review.
## Data Sources
in this project the dataset that was utilized is:
- imdb_10K_sentimnets_reviews.csv
## Problem Statement
Since many reviews carry valuable and valid opinions whether the viewer had a positive or negative experience,but going through thousands of reviews and classifying them can be energy and time consuming.
The main goal in this project was to build a Sequential model to classify the reviews as positive or negative based on each review.
## Content
Data Acquisition and Exploration: Reading and exploring the datasets to understand the available data.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, tokenizing, and padding text reviews to prepare them for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing sentiment distribution and review patterns to gain insights.
Model Building: Constructing an LSTM model using embeddings to capture context and sequence information for sentiment prediction.
Conclusion: Summarizing the modelâ€™s performance and key takeaways from the analysis.
## usage
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/reviewssentiments.git
Open the Jupyter Notebook file "reviewssentiments.py".
Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code step by step.
## Results
Once you execute the notebook, you will gain insights into the process of categorizing movie reviews as either positive or negative in sentiment.
The LSTM-based deep learning model will generate predictions for new reviews, while evaluation metrics like accuracy and validation results will demonstrate how well the model interprets sentiment patterns in natural language.
